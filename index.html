Super simple idea behind this week's assignment: use the
restaurant menu REST API to create a master/detail view pair.

Your application should have 3 views (i.e., 3 view states): home
(home), categories list (categories), items list (items).

As long as the views are functional and readable, the styling
does not really matter and is not graded.

When the user goes to / path in your application, a home
screen should be shown. It's up to you what you place on the
home screen. You can just say "Welcome to our Restaurant".
The home screen should have a link to a list of categories of
menu items in the restaurant. Clicking that link would obviously
take the user to the /categories view.

The categories view should list all available categories of items
on the menu. Each listing should be a link. Clicking that link
should take the user to the /items view. Note that since what
the items view state shows is dependent on which category 
the user clicked, the URL mapping will need to have a parameter
in it. I.e., don't take the URLs I am listing in the assignment 
description as literal URLs. They are just naming hints.

Make sure that if, while viewing the list of menu items for a 
particular category, the user copies the URL in the browser's 
address bar and pastes it into a new tab or a different 
browser, that the view is the same as the original one.
